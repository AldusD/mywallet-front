## SPA Interface for MyWallet app created using *Create React App* 

*MyWallet is mobile responsive only*

*[App Deploy](https://mywalletfinances.vercel.app)* |
*[back-end repository](https://github.com/AldusD/mywallet-back)*

As one of the weekly projects from Driven Education's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, MyWallet was meant to reinforce the following learnt knowledge:
- Registering users and saving password with criptography
- Manage users access with sessions and access tokens
- CRUD with MongoDb 
- Separate responsabilities in specific files: Routers, middlewares and controllers 
- Creation of single page application using React Framework

#### How To Start MyWallet
- 1 - Clone both front-end and back-end repositories
- 2 - Install all production dependencies using 'npm install'
- 3 - If wanted, fill the .env files to specify where to run the API and how front-end app can find it 
- 4 - Run on root directory 'node app.js' on back-end project
- 5 - Run on root directory 'npm start' on front-end project

#### Explaining the recent new branch
- Feat/finishing-project branch was meant to complete project intentions that at the time I struggled to complete in time   
- The upgrades brought by feat/finishing-project branch respected the tecnologies and tools limitations I had at the time

#### Acknowledged mistakes and limitations:
- Buttons on home will, in some devices will block balance text  
- API calls are exposed in components file
- Not using hooks

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
